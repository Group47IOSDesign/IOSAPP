## Bebe Baby

 ### App Description
// An invaluable new parenting tool which will allow parents to finally be able to locate baby changing facilities around them. The app would show not only the baby changing facilitities located in women's bathrooms and family bathrooms but also in the men's bathrooms. The app will use real time and push notifications in order to send coupons to the user to entice them into local businesses, which have the baby changing facilities.

 ### App Idea Evaluation
// 
- **Category**: Lifestyle
- **Description:** Be able to find changing tables all over, incuding ones in men's bathrooms. Using your location, the app would show you the nearest changing table and offer you incentives such as coupons for the restaurants.Reviews on cleanliness in bathroom.
- **Mobile:** It would require maps, location, and real time push notifications.
- **Story:** Compelling story of a new father whose wife died in childbirth and he struggles to find changing tables located in mens bathrooms. Parents on road trip trying to change a child in the trunk of a car because no where has a clean changing table.
- **Market:** Large market base, many families.
- **Habit:** Customers would stay until the baby no longer need diapers. This means customers would generally stay for around 4-5 years. But then we will still be getting new customers as new parents receive information about our app. 
- **Scope:** First version: We can use Google maps API to locate facilities that are close by Second version: Better UI design Third version: To ask companies and merchants to sign up for our app.
